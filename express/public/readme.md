In order to directly serve static/public resources as such as images, CSS, client-side JS put them in a root directory named, for example, like `public` and enable it as a server of public static content by `app.user( express.static('public') )`, where `var app = express()` To access a resouce, for example `public/img/hayek.jpg`, go to `http://localhost:port/img/hayek.jpg`. Note `public` is not needed in the URI.
